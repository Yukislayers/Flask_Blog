# Overview

This tutorial has introduced the essential concepts of the Flask Python framework. You learned how to create a small web application, run it in a development server and allow the user to provide custom data via URL parameters and web forms. You've also used the Jinja template engine to reuse HTML files and use logic within them. By the end of this tutorial, you now have a fully functional web blog that interacts with an SQLite database to create, display, modify and delete blog posts using Python and SQL queries.
